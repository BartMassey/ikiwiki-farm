ikiwiki farm software
Bart Massey <bart@cs.pdx.edu>

This set of files constitutes an ikiwiki installer (and
remover) suitable for wiki "farming".

To make a wiki:

  * Copy template.cnf to cnf/yourwikiname.cnf and edit it
    appropriately. Note that no checking is done on your
    .cnf file, so be careful.  When you are done, add
    your config file to the git repo there so that you can
    track changes to it.
  
  * Run "sh mkwiki.sh cnf/yourwikiname.cnf >/tmp/script".
    This will emit a shell script that will create the wiki.
    Inspect the script.
  
  * When you are ready, run "sh /tmp/script", which will do
    the work of setting everything up.

* To remove a wiki:

    sh rmwiki.sh yourwikiname.cnf >/tmp/script
    sh /tmp/script

  Note that little sanity checking is done on removes, so be
  careful.

Templates:

  The files apache2-site.txt, htaccess, ikiwiki.setup and
  index.mdwn are templates that will be macro-expanded and
  used as part of your wiki.  See setvars.sh, mkwiki.sh and
  template.cnf for a list of valid macro names.
