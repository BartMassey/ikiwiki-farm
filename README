This set of files constitutes an ikiwiki and mailman list
installer (and remover) suitable for wiki "farming".

To make a wiki (and possibly a mailman list):

  * Copy template.cnf to cnf/yourwikiname.cnf and edit it
    appropriately. Note that no checking is done on your
    .cnf file, so be careful.  When you are done, add
    your config file to the git repo there so that you can
    track changes to it.
  
  * Run "sh mkwiki.sh cnf/yourwikiname.cnf >/tmp/script".
    This will emit a shell script that will create the wiki.
    Inspect the script.
  
  * When you are ready, run "sh /tmp/script", which will do
    the work of setting everything up.

* To remove a wiki (and any associated mailman list):

    sh rmwiki.sh yourwikiname.cnf >/tmp/script
    sh /tmp/script

  Note that little sanity checking is done on removes, so be
  careful.

Templates:

  The files apache2-site.txt, htaccess, ikiwiki.setup,
  index.mdwn and mailman-config are templates that will be
  macro-expanded and used as part of your wiki.  See
  setvars.sh, mkwiki.sh and template.cnf for a list of valid
  macro names.
